  ║ The Flutter tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature usage ║
  ║ statistics and basic crash reports. This data is used to help improve      ║
  ║ Flutter tools over time.                                                   ║

  ║ Flutter tool analytics are not sent on the very first run. To disable      ║
  ║ reporting, type 'flutter config --no-analytics'. To display the current    ║
  ║ setting, type 'flutter config'. If you opt out of analytics, an opt-out    ║
  ║ event will be sent, and then no further information will be sent by the    ║
  ║ Flutter tool.                                                              ║

Resolving dependencies...
Note: intl is pinned to version 0.18.1 by flutter_localizations from the flutter SDK.
See https://dart.dev/go/sdk-version-pinning for details.


Because farm_assist_ai depends on flutter_localizations from sdk which depends on intl 0.18.1, intl 0.18.1 is required.
So, because farm_assist_ai depends on intl ^0.19.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Consider downgrading your constraint on intl: flutter pub add intl:^0.18.1
The Flutter CLI developer tool uses Google Analytics to report usage and diagnostic data
along with package dependencies, and crash reporting to send basic crash reports.
This data is used to help improve the Dart platform, Flutter framework, and related tools.

Telemetry is not sent on the very first run.
To disable reporting of telemetry, run this terminal command:

flutter --disable-telemetry.
If you opt out of telemetry, an opt-out event will be sent,
and then no further information will be sent.
