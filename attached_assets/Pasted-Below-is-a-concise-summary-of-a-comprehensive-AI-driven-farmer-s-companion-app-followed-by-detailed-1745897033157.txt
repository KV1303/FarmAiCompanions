Below is a concise summary of a comprehensive AI-driven farmer’s companion app, followed by detailed sections on core features, AI modules, data sources (including national mandi prices), technical architecture, and recommended integrations. Citations are provided throughout from diverse, high-quality sources.  

In summary, your **FarmAssist AI** app will guide farmers through the entire crop lifecycle—from sowing decisions driven by predictive analytics to real-time nutrient and pest management, through to dynamic market pricing via India’s eNAM platform. By leveraging satellite and sensor-based crop monitoring (e.g. Farmonaut) alongside AI-powered decision engines (e.g. Agrio, Climate Corporation), the app ensures data-backed recommendations on irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application while also providing an organic alternative database. Finally, integration with the eNAM API delivers up-to-date mandi prices to maximize revenue at harvest.
